Brief Introduction
===================

We’re going to go through the essential setup tips of the PRO’s - those that use Python from R via reticulate.

    1.Install TensorFlow in R

    2.Do a Image Recognition Analysis to verify TensorFlow is working.
    
Setting up TensorFlow in R is an insane productivity booster. You can leverage the best of Python + R. But you still need to learn how to use Python and R together for real business projects. And, it’s impossible to teach you all the in’s and out’s in 1 short article.

Installing TensorFlow in R
=============================

This process should take under 5-minutes. First we have some requirments to get TensorFlow 2 installed.

TensorFlow 2.0.0 Requirements
